I am an engineering manager at LinkedIn, working on various natural language processing/machine learning techniques, such as classification, sequence labeling, ranking, language generation, unsupervised pretraining, etc. Before joining LinkedIn at 2016, I was a research scientist at Yahoo Labs. I got my PhD in NLP from Columbia University, and bachelor degree from Sun Yat-sen University. I have more than 20 publications with thousands of citations.

I am passionate about designing efficient and effective NLP/ML models for search & recommender systems, for example, search ranking, spell correction, intent classification, auto completion, query suggestions, etc. The NLP models are deployed in LinkedIn's commercial systems, and the works are published in top conferences.
